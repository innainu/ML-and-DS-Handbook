# ML-and-DS-Handbook
Ipython notebook of various notes and code snippets for concepts in Machine Learning and Data Science. Work in progress.

I've converted the ipython notebook into markdown using [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for a hopefully easier version control experience. To contribute, edit the ipython notebook, convert to markdown, and then submit a pull request.
