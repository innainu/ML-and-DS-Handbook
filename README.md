## Contributing

You can create a github issue or make pull-requests.

To make a pull-request:

- Make your changes in the [ipython notebook](/ML_Notes.ipynb)

- I've uploaded the ipython notebook as markdown for better version control, and as html to view on github, so next, run this script:

- Make sure you have [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) installed.
